# Sterling Object-Oriented Database for Silverlight and Windows Phone 7

**The best place to look is the unit tests.** The majority of questions on the forum are around issues that relate to changes to the API between versions and/or missing set up. The database ships will a full suite of tests not only for the database in general, but also for the specific drivers available on each platform. You should be able to look at the tests for these to determine how to configure, set up, and create expected behavior in the application. If you feel there is a test missing, please open a new topic in the discussion tab and let us know. If you have a persistent problem, the easiest and fastest way for resolution is to provide a standalone test - that is a .cs file with a unit test that can be dropped into one of the test projects - that replicates the issue. With this we can quickly reproduce the problem and troubleshoot it.
